USIS_exposure_types
}
\description{
Types of exposure reported. Types of standard verified by the samples.
Associate exposure type identifiers with exposure type names.
}
\note{
Exposure type "F" for "Not Detected (N/D) or Not Found (N/F)" originally used
in IMIS data and listed in the first document mentionned in 'Source' section
was not included in this dataset since this category does not express a type
of standard and is no longer used in OIS data.
See in \code{\link{USIS_measures}} the variable named \code{is_detected} used to define if
the sampled substance is actually detected.
