employee the most at risk from exposure, according to the U.S.
census occupational classification system.

employees.}

\description{
Industrial hygiene measurements in the United States between 1971 and 2021.
It contains results of inspections conducted by both federal and state
inspectors.
}
\details{
Measure identifiers were created for all measures.

Sheet identifiers were created for all existing combinations of a sheet
number and an inspection identifier.
}
\note{
Further works will be to identify the versions of the U.S. census
occupational classification systems used for data of the variable
\code{occ_title} as well as the corresponding identifiers.
This will lead to the removal of the variable \code{occ_title} and to the
completion of the variable \code{occ_id} (currently \code{NA} when \code{occ_title} is
not).
