\details{
Inspection type identifiers C1, L1 and L2 were created because their
corresponding types are only used in OIS data and type identifiers does not
exist in OIS data. These are sub-categories of types C and L.
Such inspections may exist in IMIS data but are labeled C and L.

Inspection types A and M may have been confused in some data.
