\format{
Matrix of 81,915 rows (whose names are workplace identifiers) and 3
columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{establishment_id}}{Identifier of the establishment.}
\item{\code{sic_id}}{Identifier of the industry, according to the U.S. Standard
Industrial Classification of 1987.
Only available for IMIS data.}
\item{\code{naics_id}}{Identifier of the industry, according to the North
American Industry Classification System.}
}

Data provided by the \href{https://www.osha.gov/}{OSHA}, except workplace
and establishment identifiers (see 'Details' section).

\usage{
USIS_workplaces
}
\description{
Workplaces where samples were taken. One workplace is defined by one
establishment and at least one industry class.
}
\details{
Workplace identifiers were created for all existing combinations of an
establishment, a SIC class and a NAICS class.

Establishment identifiers were created by assigning the same one to close
establishment names associated with the same location. Similarities between
establishment names were computed algorithmically.
}
\note{
Only the version of 2002 of the North American Industry Classification System
is currently available in the reference table \code{\link{NAICS}}. This version allows
to identify almost all values of \code{naics_id}.
Further works will be to identify the NAICS versions associated with values
not belonging to the one of 2002. This will lead to a modification of the
structures of the datasets \code{NAICS} and/or \code{USIS_workplaces}.
